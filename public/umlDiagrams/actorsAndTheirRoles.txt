Actors and Their Roles
Here are the main actors in your system and what each one does (you can paste this into the document under “Actors and Their Roles”):

1) End User
Uses the assistant through voice, hotkeys, or the UI dashboard.

Enables/disables features (camera, screen/context, proactivity).

Controls privacy using:

Privacy Mode hotkey (turns off camera + screen/context instantly)

Camera toggle hotkey (camera only)

Gives permission approvals when needed.

2) Client UI (Electron + React)
Displays the assistant interface (dashboard, chat/history, settings).

Shows status indicators (mic/camera/privacy mode/server online).

Sends user actions to the orchestrator (button clicks, toggles, hotkey events).

Presents results (notifications, responses, errors).

3) Client Orchestrator / Policy Layer (Node.js + Express inside Electron)
The decision authority of the whole system.

Decides when the assistant should:

listen

speak

stay quiet

call the LLM

Enforces:

permissions (mic/camera/screen)

privacy mode rules

cooldowns / do-not-disturb rules

tool allowlist (what actions are permitted)

Executes approved actions locally on the client.

Handles fallback if the AI server is offline.

4) Python Emotion Detection Engine (Local, Optional)
Runs only if camera permission is enabled and privacy mode is OFF.

Reads the camera locally and produces emotion signals (label/confidence/timestamp).

Sends only lightweight results to the orchestrator (no raw video sharing).

5) Remote LLM Inference Server (GTX 1650 Desktop)
Receives requests from clients over HTTPS + authentication.

Runs the language model to generate:

response text

suggested actions (from an allowed tool list)

Does not access the user’s OS or execute tools.

6) Operating System / System Tools (Client-Side)
Performs the actual system actions only after approval by the orchestrator:

opening apps

notifications

file/system utilities (if included)

Returns success/failure + results back to the orchestrator.

7) Local Storage (Client Device)
Stores:

settings and preferences

hotkey configurations

optional logs/history (if enabled)

Supports “clear data” / retention rules.

8) Authentication/Security Mechanism (Server Gatekeeper)
Validates client access to the LLM server (API key / token).

Can apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and overload.

If you tell me whether your document wants this as (a) bullet list, (b) table, or (c) UML “Actor list” style, I’ll format it exactly like your template.
