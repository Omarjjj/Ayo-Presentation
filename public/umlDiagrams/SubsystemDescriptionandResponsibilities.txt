Client Application Subsystem
Responsibility
This subsystem represents everything that runs on the user’s device. It is responsible for user interaction, decision‑making, privacy enforcement, and safe execution of actions.

Main responsibilities
Provide the desktop user interface.

Capture user input (voice, hotkeys, UI actions).

Enforce privacy, permissions, and safety rules.

Coordinate communication with AI services.

Execute approved system actions locally.

Key components
Electron + React UI

Node.js Policy & Orchestrator

Hotkey Manager

Permission Manager

Privacy Manager

Context Collector

Tool Execution Layer

Local Storage

Why this subsystem is critical
This subsystem is the authority of the system.
Even when AI is involved, no action can happen without this subsystem approving it.

2) Presentation (UI) Subsystem
Responsibility
Handles all user-facing interaction and feedback.

Responsibilities in detail
Display assistant dashboard and chat interface.

Show system status indicators:

microphone

camera

privacy mode

AI server availability

Allow users to:

configure settings

customize hotkeys

enable/disable features

Provide feedback for system states:

listening

processing

responding

errors and fallback modes

Boundaries
The UI does not make decisions.

It forwards events to the Orchestrator and displays results.

3) Policy & Orchestration Subsystem (Core Logic)
Responsibility
This is the central control subsystem and the most important part of the system.

Responsibilities in detail
Receive all triggers:

user requests

hotkeys

proactive events

Enforce deterministic rules:

permission checks

privacy mode enforcement

cooldowns and do‑not‑disturb

tool allowlisting

Decide:

whether to call the LLM

what context can be shared

whether an AI suggestion is safe

Coordinate the full flow:
Input → Policy Check → AI Reasoning (optional) → Validation → Action → Response

Key design rule
AI suggestions are never trusted blindly.
The policy subsystem validates everything before execution.

4) Voice Interaction Subsystem
Responsibility
Handles speech-based interaction between the user and the assistant.

Responsibilities in detail
Capture audio from the microphone.

Convert speech to text (STT).

Deliver spoken responses (TTS).

Integrate with policy checks (e.g., microphone permission).

Privacy consideration
Voice input is processed only when explicitly triggered.

Microphone usage is fully permission‑controlled.

5) Context & Proactivity Subsystem
Responsibility
Provides situational awareness while remaining lightweight and non-intrusive.

Responsibilities in detail
Monitor:

active applications

idle time

usage patterns

Detect situations where help might be useful.

Generate proactive events only when allowed by policy.

Constraints
Does not interrupt the user arbitrarily.

Always respects:

cooldown rules

privacy mode

do‑not‑disturb settings

6) Emotion Detection Subsystem (Optional, Local)
Responsibility
Provide emotion-aware signals to improve interaction quality.

Responsibilities in detail
Run a Python-based emotion detection process locally.

Read camera input only if enabled.

Produce lightweight emotion signals:

emotion state

confidence

timestamp

Send signals to the orchestrator for optional use.

Privacy guarantees
No raw video is stored or transmitted.

Can be instantly disabled using:

privacy mode hotkey

camera toggle hotkey

7) AI Reasoning Subsystem (Remote LLM Server)
Responsibility
Provide language understanding and reasoning, not control.

Responsibilities in detail
Accept requests over HTTPS with authentication.

Run inference using a locally hosted language model.

Return:

natural language responses

optional suggested actions (structured)

Apply rate limiting and authentication.

Explicit limitation
This subsystem cannot execute OS actions.

It has no access to user hardware, files, or system APIs.

8) Tool Execution Subsystem
Responsibility
Perform actual system actions safely on the client device.

Responsibilities in detail
Execute only pre-approved tools.

Interface with the operating system (Windows).

Return execution results to the orchestrator.

Safety rules
Tools are executed only after policy approval.

If a tool fails, the system:

reports safely

logs the error

returns to a stable state

9) Data & Persistence Subsystem
Responsibility
Manage all locally stored data.

Responsibilities in detail
Store:

user settings

hotkey configurations

permission states

optional interaction logs

Support:

retention policies

clear-data functionality

Never store:

raw camera frames

raw screenshots by default

10) Error Handling & Fallback Subsystem
Responsibility
Ensure the system never crashes or behaves unpredictably.

Responsibilities in detail
Detect failures:

LLM server unreachable

authentication errors

tool execution failures

permission revocations

Switch to fallback modes:

local-only responses

reduced functionality

Communicate issues clearly to the user.

11) Subsystem Collaboration Summary
Subsystem	Primary Role
UI	Interaction & feedback
Policy & Orchestrator	Decision authority
Voice	Speech input/output
Context & Proactivity	Situational awareness
Emotion Engine	Optional emotion signals
AI Reasoning Server	Language reasoning only
Tool Execution	Local OS actions
Data Storage	Settings & history
Error Handling	Stability & recovery
One-paragraph version :
The system is divided into multiple cooperating subsystems, each with a clearly defined responsibility. The client application subsystem manages user interaction, policy enforcement, and safe execution of actions. The policy and orchestration subsystem acts as the central decision authority, ensuring privacy, permissions, and safety constraints are enforced before any AI reasoning or system action occurs. AI capabilities are provided through a remote LLM inference subsystem accessed securely over HTTPS, while optional emotion detection runs locally to preserve privacy. Supporting subsystems handle voice interaction, context monitoring, data persistence, and error handling, together forming a robust, privacy-aware, and modular desktop assistant architecture.
